=== LLM ANALYSIS RESPONSE ===

ℹ️ RESOURCE UNDERUTILIZATION NOTICE: Pod fastapi-app-7f6d7cf966-wtt5d, Container fastapi-app

Both CPU and memory usage are significantly below requested resources.

LOW CPU USAGE DETECTED: The container is only using 1.3% of its requested cpu (6.5m). This is below the low threshold of 100.0m and may indicate over-provisioning. Consider reducing resource requests to improve cluster utilization efficiency.

LOW MEMORY USAGE DETECTED: The container is only using 11.4% of its requested memory (29.3Mi). This is below the low threshold of 50.0Mi and may indicate over-provisioning. Consider reducing resource requests to improve cluster utilization efficiency.

RECOMMENDATION: The container is overprovisioned. Consider reducing CPU and memory requests to improve cluster resource efficiency. For cost optimization, these resources could be better allocated to other workloads.
